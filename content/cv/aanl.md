Research topics:
  * Stochastic processes, Soft matter physics. 
  * Effects of weak magnetic field on biological matter.
	* Explain the effect with the theoretical model:
	* purpose mechanism by the framework of non-equilibrium statistical physics.
  * An extension of the Bohr-Van Leeuwen theorem
	* magnetic field does not influence the state of a classical equilibrium system.
    * We show that it does influence the long-time state of the thermal bath:
    * the magnetic field induces an average orbital momentum for uncharged bath particles
    * the particles, separate into two sets rotating in opposite directions.
