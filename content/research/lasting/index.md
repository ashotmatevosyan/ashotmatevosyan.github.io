intro: |
    The Bohr-Van Leeuwen theorem states that classical systems in equilibrium are unaffected by static magnetic fields. This work explores how a charged Brownian particle in a thermal bath still induces a long-lasting angular momentum in the bath. Our finding shows that while the particle itself remains unaffected in equilibrium, the surrounding bath exhibits a persistent response, challenging traditional views on classical magnetism and opening up new research possibilities in fields like plasma physics and biophysics.
