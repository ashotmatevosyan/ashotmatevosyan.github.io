intro: |
    In the study of magnetobiology, understanding how weak magnetic fields interact with biological systems has long been a challenging question. We propose a mechanisms by which weak, static magnetic fields can influence biological matter, despite the high thermal noise and friction present in cellular environments. By examining the nonequilibrium steady states of cellular ions in a confining potential, it is shown that a weak magnetic field can induce cyclotron motion, providing insights into how such fields may impact biological processes at the molecular level. This research sheds light on the fundamental interactions between magnetic fields and biological matter, contributing to the broader understanding of magnetobiology.
